# **App Baseline – Global Access & Admin Dashboard**

**Owner-approved clarifications integrated (2026-04-12):**
- Current supported access-code roles are `Admin`, `CompanyOwner`, and `Driver` (truck user is deprecated/historical, not current intended behavior).
- Owner dispatch visibility is company-scoped, with truck-specific detail logic in drawer/notification/per-truck flows.
- Driver dispatch visibility is assignment-scoped.
- Driver acknowledgement is tracked via `DriverDispatch` seen/open state (`delivery_status`, `last_seen_at`, `last_opened_at`) and not a driver confirm-receipt button.
- Admin can review driver acknowledgement history in **Admin Confirmations → Driver Dispatch Log**.
- Access codes are intended as one-time-use first-link credentials across roles; once claimed/linked successfully, they are permanently tied to that user/account and cannot be reused by another user.
- Admin users are normally linked via Admin access codes (same claim flow as other roles), while Base44 app owner/account behavior also exists as a backup admin-capable path that may not rely on normal claimed access-code linkage.
- Owner Action Needed state should mirror owner notification pending state and remain active until all currently selected trucks on a dispatch are confirmed (or the dispatch is deleted, or unconfirmed truck(s) are removed).
- Admin SMS infrastructure/rules are prepared but currently not enabled in live operations; when enabled, admin SMS mirrors admin in-app notification categories and is not the same owner/driver live dispatch SMS flow.




## **1\. Application Entry (Login Page)**

* Navigating to **app.ccgnj.com** (desktop or mobile) first follows the Base44 authenticated sign-in gate, then lands in the in-app **Access Code Login** linking screen
* Users enter a valid **access code** to link their authenticated user identity to an app role/session
* **Mobile behavior:** A popup appears suggesting the user install the app, including instructions
* **Desktop behavior:** No install prompt is shown

### **1.1 Access-code linking intent (clarified)**
* All role links use the same first-link claim pattern:
  * Access code is created
  * User signs up/logs in via Base44
  * User enters access code in Access Code Login
  * Successful claim links that user identity/session to the role/workspace
* One-time-use intent:
  * After successful first claim, the code is considered permanently linked to that user/account
  * It is not intended to be reusable by a different user later
* Admin-specific nuance:
  * Standard admin users are still intended to link through Admin access codes
  * Base44 app owner/account behavior also exists as a backup admin-capable access path and may not always appear as a normal claimed admin access-code-linked user

---

## **2\. Admin User Flow**

* Logging in as an **Admin** routes the user to the **Admin Dashboard** by default

---

## **3\. Global Header (All Pages)**

* A **persistent header** is displayed across all pages and does not change
* **Left side:**
  * Company logo
  * Line 1: Company name
    * Admin → always “CCG Transit”
    * Company Owner → their company name
    * Driver → their assigned company
  * Line 2: Workspace identity label (usually user name). For Admin view this is shown as `Name (Admin)`; company owner/driver views show role-specific identity labels without exposing internal workspace fields.
  * Note: added after code-backed review (2026-03-24).
* **Right side:**
  * Notification bell
  * Menu button (contains Profile)
  * Logout button

---

## **11\. Approved Clarification Addendum (2026-04-13): Multi-Owner / Owner Personal Profile / Owner-as-Driver**

### **11.1 Terms / Interpretation Rules**

* **Company-level state** means operational state shared across all company-owner users for the same company (dispatches, availability, company-facing actions, and shared company profile data).
* **Owner user** means an individual authenticated company-owner account linked to the same company workspace as other owners at that company.
* **Owner assignment (informational)** means selecting a company-owner user in truck assignment UI strictly for owner/admin visibility context; this is not a normal driver assignment workflow.
* **Shared notification result state** means notification completion/read resolution can apply to all owner users together, while still preserving actor attribution in logs/history.

### **11.2 Multiple Company-Owner Users per Company**

* A company may have more than one company-owner user.
* All company-owner users for the same company share one company workspace and one company-level operational state.
* Dispatches, availability, shared company profile data, and company-facing operational actions remain company-level and are not split into separate owner workspaces.
* Logs/history should identify the exact owner user who performed each action whenever possible.

### **11.3 Shared In-App Owner Notification Behavior**

* Company-owner notifications remain shared in effect at the company level.
* When a company-level notification is sent, all company-owner users for that company can see it.
* Action-required notifications (example: new dispatch, dispatch update, similar company action) remain active for all owner users until the underlying company-level action is completed.
* Once completed by one owner user, that related notification/action-needed state clears for all owner users.
* Informational notifications (example: driver-seen acknowledgements) should be considered read for all owner users once one owner user opens/views the related notification context.
* Availability-related owner notifications clear for all owner users once the related company availability action is completed.
* Shared result state does not remove attribution: the system should still record which owner user performed read/open/action events.

### **11.4 Owner SMS Is User-Specific (Not Shared Company Contact-Routed)**

* Owner SMS routing no longer depends on choosing a shared company contact destination for owner notifications.
* Shared company contact methods remain in the company profile for general business information only.
* Each company-owner user has an individual personal phone number and an individual SMS opt-in setting.
* The owner user personal profile phone number is the SMS destination for that owner user.
* Owner notification SMS eligibility is evaluated per owner user:
  * If only one owner is opted in, only that owner receives SMS.
  * If both owners are opted in, both owners receive SMS.
  * If neither owner is opted in, neither owner receives SMS.

### **11.5 Shared Company Profile vs Personal Owner Profile**

* Shared company profile remains company-level (for example: company name, address, shared company contact methods).
* Company-owner users also have personal owner profile data for individual identity/settings.
* Personal owner profile baseline minimum fields:
  * Owner display name
  * Owner phone number used for SMS
  * Owner SMS opt-in
* Shared company contacts are not the source of owner SMS routing.

### **11.6 Owner Selection in Dispatch Truck Assignment UI**

* Company-owner users may appear in the same dispatch assignment dropdown area as drivers, but only when eligibility conditions are met.
* Owner-selection option is available only if either condition is true:
  * Company has more than one truck, or
  * Company has at least one added driver.
* If a company has only one truck and no added drivers, do not require extra owner self-assignment; owner operation of that truck is implicit.
* When owner selection is available, owner options should be clearly labeled as owner entries (example: `Ronald (Owner)`).
* Selecting a company-owner user is informational only for owner/admin visibility.
* If an owner user is selected for a truck:
  * Show owner name next to truck assignment badge in the dispatch drawer.
  * Show owner name next to the truck in admin views as well.
* Selecting an owner user must not create normal driver workflow side effects:
  * No separate driver notification
  * No driver dispatch copy
  * No driver-seen acknowledgement
  * No driver removal/cancellation notification
  * No separate driver login/profile requirement
  * No additional dispatch lifecycle/state beyond showing that owner assignment
* Regular non-owner drivers continue to work exactly as current behavior defines.

### **11.7 Multi-Owner Owner-Assignment Clarification**

* If a company has multiple company-owner users, any eligible owner user may appear in owner-selectable assignment options when owner selection is enabled.
* One owner user may assign themselves or another owner user to a truck as an informational owner assignment.
* This owner selection remains non-driver workflow behavior.

### **11.8 Recent Company Activity on Company-Owner Home**

* Company-owner Home includes a recent company activity section.
* This section is a company-scoped recent activity feed visible to company-owner users for that company.
* Feed should show recent meaningful actions performed on behalf of the shared company workspace, including actions by either owner user.
* Purpose: keep multi-owner teams aware of recent shared-company actions/changes.
* This feed complements notifications; it does not replace notifications.

### **11.9 What Remains Unchanged**

Unless a later approval explicitly changes them, the following behaviors remain unchanged:

* Normal non-owner driver notification behavior
* Normal driver assignment/removal behavior
* Driver-specific dispatch notifications and seen acknowledgements for actual drivers
* Company-level dispatch confirmation flow for owners
* Availability remains company-level
* Admin-created company profile structure remains company-level
* Owners continue receiving company dispatch updates in the same general way currently defined

### **11.10 High-Risk / Be Careful When Implementing Later**

Implementation later should be especially careful around:

* Notification reconciliation/read-state behavior across multiple owners
* SMS eligibility/delivery logic per owner user
* Owner session/access-code linking behavior in multi-owner scenarios
* Dispatch assignment UI branching between owner options and actual drivers
* Audit/log attribution for owner read/action events
* Preserving all existing non-owner driver behavior unchanged
